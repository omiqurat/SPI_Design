# Grouping and ungrouping are helpful when you need to change your design hierarchy as
# part of your synthesis strategy. Grouping builds a level of hierarchy around a set of instances.
# ungrouping flattens a level of hierarchy. The following ungrouping command makes the rtl compiler
# optimize for timing, area or both during ungrouping...
# set_attribute auto_ungroup {none | timing | area | both} 

# read_hdl <hdl_file_names>
# when you issue the read_hdl command, RTL compiler reads the files and performs syntax checks
# -v1995 (default): IEEE Std 1364-1995 compliance
# -v2001 : IEEE Std 1364-2001 compliance
# type in the verilog files of your design after the read_hdl statement:
read_hdl final_I.v

#elaborate <top_level_design_name>
# the elaborate command builds the design (creats a design object). During elaboration RTL compiler
# performs the following tasks:
# 1. builds data structures
# 2. infers registers in the design
# 3. perfroms higher-level HDL optimization, such as dead code removal
# 4. check semantics
# after elaboration, RTL compiler has an internally created data structure for the whole design
# so you can apply constraints and perform other operations 
elaborate

# here with you can control the amount of information RTL Compiler writes out
# in the output logfiles.  set_attribute information_level 0(min) .. 9(max).

# the synthesizing includes following steps:
# 1. sythesizing the design to generic logic (RTL optimizations are performed in this step)
# 2. mapping to the technology library and performing incremental optimization
# there are two options for performing the synthetize command:
# 1. synthesize -to_generic: performs RTL optimization on your design. NOTE: when synthesize command
# is issued on an RTL design without any arguments, the -to_generic option is implied.
# 2. synthesize -to_mapped: it maps the specified design to the cells described in the supplied
# technology library and performs logic optimization(technology-independent boolean optimization,
# technology mapping nad technology-dependent gate optimization).
# setting the -effort to be high: the RTL compiler does the timing-driven structuring on larger sections
# of logic and spends more time and makes more attempts on inremental clean up. this effort level 
# involves very aggressive redundancy identification and removal. 
synthesize -effort high -to_mapped

# the final part of the RTL compiler flow involves writing out the netlists and constraints.
# to write the gate-level netlist, use the write cmd. 
# The -mapped option of the write command writes a gate-level netlist,
# in this case to the file design.v
# write_hdl > design.v      # this writes the gate-level netlist to a file calles design.v
# Modify the name of the netlist file if necessary.
